# CS308-ProgrammingLanguages

This repo is my journey in learning C++ required by the instructor of CS308 - Programming Languages at Fulbright University Vietnam. In this course, each student chooses an entirely new language and learns from scratch. 

The Programming Language Projects (PLPs) are milestones leading to the final project of the course.

Follow the table of contents below to for more details on the projects. Please read the md files for each PLP before you start.

I assume that you know at least one programming language and would like to learn another.
I hope that this repo could be a turtorial for your learning journey as well.
